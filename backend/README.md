# Contacts backend

This is the backend of my contacts app,
Django-powered REST API.

## Features

- Create a contact
- Update a contact
- Delete a contact
- Get all contacts
- Get a specific contact

This allows for the frontend app to interact and communicate with the database,
You can find the frontend at [this repo](https://gitlab.com/Ethan-Hill/contacts-app/-/tree/master/frontend)
